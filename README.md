# CFRM521
Assignment code of CFRM521 Machine Learning for Finance at the University of Washington
## Course Description
This course is an introduction to machine learning for an audience with a background in quantitative finance. The course takes a hands-on approach and favors gaining
working knowledge of several major machine learning techniques rather than focusing on a handful of methods. Students learn to use well-tested and widely used Python implementations of machine learning algorithms instead of coding them from scratch. The following topics will be covered: an overview of classification and regression techniques, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and dimensionality reduction. We also discuss selected topics in unsupervised learning and artificial neural networks.
